# 🩺 Arterial Blood Pressure Waveform Simulator

This Streamlit web app simulates a continuous **arterial blood pressure (ABP) waveform** based on user-defined systolic, diastolic, and heart rate values. It is designed for **educational and demonstration purposes**, mimicking the waveform seen on ICU monitors.

## 🚀 Features

- Real-time simulation of ABP waveform
- Adjustable inputs:
  - Systolic Pressure
  - Diastolic Pressure
  - Heart Rate
- Displays Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP)
- Clean, ICU-style waveform visualization
